Bird Strike Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes bird strike data to identify patterns and trends regarding where, when, and how often bird strikes occur. The analysis focuses on factors such as location, altitude, and time of occurrence, providing insights that can help improve aviation safety and reduce the frequency of bird strikes.

Objective
The goal of this project is to:

Identify the geographical regions most prone to bird strikes.

Determine the altitudes at which bird strikes occur most frequently.

Examine the time patterns (such as seasonal variations) of bird strikes.

Provide recommendations for aviation safety measures based on the findings.

Tools and Technologies Used
Python: Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.

Pandas: For handling and processing the dataset.

Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizing the data and trends.

Jupyter Notebook: For creating an interactive, readable environment to present the analysis.

Data Sources
The dataset used in this project includes records of bird strikes from aviation safety databases. This data includes:

Location: Latitude and longitude of the bird strike.

Altitude: The altitude at which the bird strike occurred.

Time: The date and time the bird strike was recorded.

Other factors: Weather conditions, flight phase, and aircraft type (if available).

Methodology
Data Cleaning: The dataset was cleaned to handle missing or erroneous values. Data normalization was also applied where necessary.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Various statistical methods and visualizations were employed to explore trends in the bird strike data.

Pattern Recognition: The data was analyzed to find significant trends in bird strikes related to geography, altitude, and time.

Results
Geographical Hotspots: Identified regions with the highest frequency of bird strikes.

Altitude Trends: Determined which altitudes had the most bird strikes.

Seasonality: Analyzed if there are certain times of the year when bird strikes are more common.
